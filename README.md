# Forest Cover Type Prediction using Machine Learning Approaches

## Overview
This project aims to predict the forest cover type using machine learning algorithms. The application leverages Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms to classify the type of forest cover. The application is built using Streamlit for an interactive web interface.

## Features
- Utilizes Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms for prediction.
- Provides an interactive web interface using Streamlit.
- Supports various input features for accurate prediction.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or above
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- streamlit
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
